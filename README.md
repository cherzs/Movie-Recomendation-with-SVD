# üé¨ **Movie Recommendation System Project**

## üöÄ **Project Overview**
This project aims to develop an accurate and personalized movie recommendation system using two datasets: one containing basic movie information, including the cast and crew, and the other containing detailed metadata such as budget, genre, popularity, and ratings. The goal is to leverage these datasets to recommend movies to users based on their preferences.

## üìä **Datasets Used**
This project utilizes two datasets from Kaggle, providing comprehensive data about various movies:

1. **Movies Dataset 1**:  
   [The Movies Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rounakbanik/the-movies-dataset)  
   Key Features:
   - `movie_id`: Unique identifier for each movie.
   - `cast`: The names of lead and supporting actors.
   - `crew`: The names of key crew members (Director, Editor, Composer, Writer, etc.).

2. **Movies Dataset 2**:  
   [TMDB Movie Metadata](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tmdb/tmdb-movie-metadata)  
   Key Features:
   - `budget`: The budget in which the movie was made.
   - `genre`: The genre(s) of the movie (e.g., Action, Comedy, Thriller).
   - `homepage`: A link to the homepage of the movie.
   - `id`: The movie_id corresponding to the first dataset.
   - `keywords`: Keywords or tags related to the movie.
   - `original_language`: Language in which the movie was made.
   - `original_title`: The original title of the movie.
   - `overview`: A brief description of the movie.
   - `popularity`: Numeric value representing the movie's popularity.
   - `production_companies`: The production house of the movie.
   - `production_countries`: The country of production.
   - `release_date`: The date of movie release.
   - `revenue`: Worldwide revenue generated by the movie.
   - `runtime`: Movie runtime in minutes.
   - `status`: Movie status (Released or Rumored).
   - `tagline`: The tagline of the movie.
   - `title`: Title of the movie.
   - `vote_average`: The average rating received by the movie.
   - `vote_count`: The total count of votes received.

## üõ†Ô∏è **Tools and Technologies**

This project leverages a variety of tools and libraries to process data, build models, and visualize results:

### **Programming Language**:
- **Python**: The core programming language used for developing the recommendation system.

### **Libraries**:
- **pandas**: For data manipulation and preprocessing.
- **numpy**: For numerical operations.
- **matplotlib** & **seaborn**: For data visualization and plotting.
- **surprise**: A Python library for building and evaluating collaborative filtering-based recommendation systems.
- **gensim**: For Word2Vec, a technique used to capture word semantics for content-based filtering.
- **scikit-learn**: For machine learning algorithms and model evaluation.
- **Flask**: To serve the recommendation system as a web service.
- **wordcloud**: For visualizing keywords and other text data as word clouds.
- **TfidfVectorizer**: From **scikit-learn**, used to convert a collection of text documents to a matrix of TF-IDF features for content-based filtering.

### **Algorithms and Techniques**:
- **Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)**: Used for collaborative filtering-based recommendations.
- **Content-Based Filtering**: A method that recommends movies based on their metadata such as genre, keywords, and cast.
- **Collaborative Filtering**: A method that recommends movies based on user-item interactions, utilizing techniques like matrix factorization.
  
### üîç **Key Insights**  
- Combining user behavior and movie metadata provides richer recommendations.  
- Preprocessing and feature engineering significantly improved model accuracy.  

### üìÇ **Repository**  
The source code, detailed documentation, and visualization of results are included in this repository for reproducibility and further development.
